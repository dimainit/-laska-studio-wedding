# Studio Láska – First Evaluation Project

This project was created as my first major evaluation after several months of studying web development.

The main goal was to test my knowledge and see how confidently I can build a structured layout using HTML, CSS, and especially SCSS. The project also simulates working with a designer — translating a visual concept into real code.

At the current stage, this is a static layout prototype of a wedding studio website.

The project focuses on:

- Semantic HTML structure
- SCSS architecture (base + components)
- Clean project organization
- Hover effects and UI interactions
- Visual accuracy based on a design layout

Responsive design (media queries) is currently in progress and being refined. Some layout adjustments are still being improved as part of the learning process.

The next project will focus on building a fully interactive and dynamic version using JavaScript.

This project reflects my current level after several months of learning and demonstrates my approach to structuring and styling a modern website.
